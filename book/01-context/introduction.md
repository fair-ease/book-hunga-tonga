# Where did we start?

The **Hunga Tonga** record-breaking explosive eruption on **January 15th 2022** was one of the largest of the 21st century.

- One article claims the observation of a phytoplankton bloom in the days following the eruption:  
  Barone et al. 2022 – [doi:10.1029/2022GL099293](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL099293)  

- This analysis was **rebutted** in another paper based on Argo biogeochemical data:  
  Franz et al. (larger scale BGC-Argo data compared to Barone et al.).

- A third paper, based on on-site expedition data collected **several weeks after the eruption**, observed a significant increase in metal concentrations in the water:  
  Zhang et al. 2024 – excess dissolved iron and chlorophyll close to the eruption.

## Questions we aimed to answer

1. Do **satellite data** (bbp, chlorophyll-a, fluorescence) confirm or refute the phytoplankton bloom?  
2. If confirmed, is the bloom due to:  
   1. Deposition of ash onto the ocean surface  
   2. Nutrients from submarine volcanic activity  
   3. Both  
3. If refuted, could the anomalies in ocean colour products be due to retrieval algorithm bias caused by:  
   1. Ash particles suspended in the atmosphere  
   2. Ash particles settled onto the surface of the ocean  
   3. Both  
4. Are **BGC-Argo data** relevant to confirm or refute the bloom?  
5. Are there **discrete water sample data** from cruises to complement understanding of submarine volcanic activity impact?  
6. Are there **biological data** related to the Hunga Tonga eruption to provide further bloom insight?

## Additional identified interests

- Study the impact on ocean biology and geochemistry from:
  1. The main explosive phase (**15 Jan 2022**)
  2. Pre-paroxysmal activity (**Dec 2021 – Jan 2022**)
  3. Previous eruption (**Dec 2014 – Jan 2015**)  

  → These earlier events are poorly documented in literature.

- Compare **Hunga Tonga** and **Etna**:
  - Etna: less ash release, but higher Argo float density in Mediterranean.

- Investigate water samples (Helium, Fe, Mn concentrations) for submarine volcanic/hydrothermal activity detection.
